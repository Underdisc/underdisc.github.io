        <p>Amperage is a 2D, top down, puzzle game in which a player must solve and quickly complete
        fantasy circuit puzzles. This game was built entirely in DigiPen's Zero Engine, a robust
        game engine that is actively developed in DigiPen's R&D department. You can find out more
        about Amperage and the Zero Engine from the links below.</p>

      <h1 class="content_header">Circuit Boards?</h1>
      <p>Amperage was the first game I worked on and completed during my time at DigiPen.
      Before DigiPen, I actually made a few games in Visual Basic, but to show them off
      now would be embarressing. Unlike most of the memories that students associate with
      their first game at DigiPen, I have fond memories of creating Amperage.
      The game was made in the GAM 100 class, the very first game class that most students at DigiPen take.</p>
      <p>At the time, I was also in one of the entry level design classes. In the
      class, one of our assignments was to work on a weekly design log. Every week,
      we had to create a game concept and write up a very bare bones GDD. And when
      I say "very bare bones", I mean it. Well, for the very first assignment,
      I wrote up the simple GDD that turned into Amperage. I actually
      still have a copy of the assignment. If you're interested, you can find the original
      pencil and paper GDD for Amperage below.</p>

      <h1 class="content_header">Creating Circuit Boards</h1>
      <p>While creating this game, I worked as both a designer and a programmer.
      When students come into DigiPen, they are not expected to have any experience
      with game development or programming. Luckily, I had been taking programming
      classes since my sophomore year of highschool. Because of this, the scripting
      came to me very easily, allowing me to take two roles on the project.</p>
      <p>One of the first tasks I did on the project was implementing the core mechanics.
      This involved implenting the basic motion of the charge on the cirucit board and
      how if interacts with parts of the circuit board. My primary goal was to create a toolset
      that would allow Dylan and I to go into the Zero Engine editor and easily create levels
      without even touching the scripts that ran them.</p>
      <p>Once we had the core features implemented and some art to pretty up the environment,
      we were free to create any levels we could come up with. The process for this level creation was
      very unique and entertaining. My method for creating the levels was to first
      draw out the entire level on graph paper so I could quickly change and edit
      problems I noticed while drawing. Once I had the idea layed out on paper, the
      next step was to put it into the engine and playtest it. I also have some copies
      of these paper prototypes still. If you're interested you can find them below.</p>
      <p><a href="../../../projects/amperage/amperage_paper_prototypes.pdf" download>amperage_paper_prototypes.pdf</a></p>
      <h1 class="content_header">Looking Back</h1>
      <p>Whilst this project wasn't too for a first DigiPen game, there are definitely
      parts that could have been done differently to make the project go more smoothly than
      it did. For one, we were using SVN at the time. Now, after two years of using Git, I can safely say
      that using SVN is probably not the best choice. Additionally,
      with the amount of programming experience I have now, I can think of ways
      to implement this game that would improve the rate at which a designer could
      create and test the level by twice the speed that we worked with.</p>
      <p>However, the biggest benefit this game brought was the team aspect.
      Before Amperage, I had never worked with a group of people on any software
      project. Though the project was almost purely stomping grounds for us, my teammates
      and I pulled a lot of experience about what it's like to work with a team. This
      can be anything from having team meetings to going out on a team lunch. Bear in mind
      this was our first team project, so we were not at the stage where we were thinking about
      the process of it all just yet.</p>
