      <h1 class="main_header content_header">Fuzor</h1>
        <p>Fuzor is a 4 player, 2D side-scroller where players take control of four spaceship crew members.
        Their goal is to externimate and escape the alien infestation that has taken over their
        ship. During their journey, players will blast their way
        through enemies and combine their weapons to wreak havoc on the infestation.
        This game was built entirely in DigiPen's Zero Engine, a robust
        game engine that is actively developed in DigiPen's R&D department. You can find out more
        about Fuzor and the Zero Engine from the links below.</p>

      <!--<h1 class="content_header">Movement</h1>
      <p>When starting this project, we knew that we wanted a movement system that would feel good for players.
      Personally, I have one major goal when programming any game system that responds to user input. When a player
      presses a button, they should not feel like they are pressing a button. They should feel like they are moving forward,
      building a structure, researching a technology, etc. In other words, it should feel like they are actually doing
      the action that they are performing in the game. There are many games that do this very well, but a few exceptional
      games with this quality are Journey and Flower by thatgamecompany. This is so important that thatgamecompany actually
      has employees dedicated to this job.</p>
      <p>When starting to create Fuzor, we knew that we wanted to accomplish this quality with the movement system. As someone
      who is very interested in game feel, I took on this job. Here, I will present the idea of how this system works under
      the hood. Keep in mind, I wrote this imlementation a long time ago, so my memory is a fuzzy, but I remember the core idea
      behind the implementation</p>-->
