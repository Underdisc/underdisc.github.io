        I will be putting all the content of an article here. When auto
        generating the website, the header and sidebar will remain almost
        the same for every page. The only difference is that the sidebar will
        highlight the currently selected page and that will be determined
        while generating the website. Everything else will remain the same
        though. Now I am going to copy and past this text a few times so we can
        have a page full of content. It will not include spacing or anything
        like that, but that is something we can worry about once we start
        worrying about the styling of the content itself. This will involve
        auto generating the content using a markdown file.
