      <h1 class="content_header">Why a Word Generator?</h1>
      <p>One day whilst attempting to come up with a name for the engine I was going to begin working on,
      I came across the idea of creating a program that could do the job for me. Many name generators have been
      create befored, so I wanted to find a generation method that I had not yet seen. After research and
      digging, I learned a lot about phonetics and its presence in the English language. This is what lead
      me to work on this small project.</p>
      <p>When I started to work on this program, the intension was to have it generate words or names that
      could or already do exist whithin the English language. As I continued to work on the project and became more
      familiar with phonetics, I realized that this could work with any language due to the simplicity of phonetics.
      I later decided to expand the program to allow for multiple languages because of this.</p>
      <h1 class="content_header">Looking Back</h1>
      <p>One of my favorite parts about making this project was the jump it allowed me to notice in my programming skills.
      I first started working on it in the Summer of 2016. During that time. I worked on the Program for a week and
      accomplished what I thought had been a decent amount of features.</p>
      <p>I never finished the project at the time and I had always wanted to since I stopped. A year later,
      I came back to finish the project and create the rules feature. The amount of work I was able to get done within a
      short two hours was almost comparable to what had taken a week before. Looking back at what had taken
      me a week to write a year ago felt embarressing. This shift made it apparent that I had become a
      much faster and more percise programmer after a year of CS assignments and an entire C++ game.</p>
