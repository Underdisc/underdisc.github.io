          <p>The Phonet Generator is a multilingual word and name generator that uses phonetics when performing
          the random generation. You can use and find out more about the Phonet Generator from
          the links below.</p>

        <h1 class="content_header">Story</h1>
        <p>One day whilst attempting to come up with a name for the engine I was going to begin working on,
        I came across the idea of creating a program that could do the job for me. Many name generators have been
        create befored, so I wanted to find a generation method that I had not yet seen. After research and
        digging, I learned a lot about phonetics and its presence in the English language. This is what lead
        me to work on this small project.</p>
        <p>When I started to work on this program, the intension was to have it generate words or names that
        could or already do exist whithin the English language. As I continued to work on the project and became more
        familiar with phonetics, I realized that this could work with any language due to the simplicity of phonetics.
        I later decided to expand the program to allow for multiple languages because of this.</p>
        <h1 class="content_header">Looking Back</h1>
        <p>One of my favorite parts about making this project was the jump it allowed me to notice in my programming skills.
        I first started working on it in the Summer of 2016. During that time. I workd on the Program for a week and
        accomplished what I thought had been a decent amount of features.</p>
        <p>I never finished the project at the time and it had always been begging me to finish it since then. A year later,
        I came back to finish the project and create the rules feature. The amount of work I was able to get done within a
        short two hours of work was almost comparable to what had taken a week before. Looking back at what had taken
        me a week to write a year ago felt embarressing.This shift allowed me to notice
        how much faster and more percise of a programmer I had become after a year of CS assignments and an entire C++ game.</p>
