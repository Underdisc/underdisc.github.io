      <h1 class="main_header content_header">X-Craft</h1>
        <p>X-Craft is a 2D, top down cooperative game where two players take control
        of a boat in order to defeat enemies. One player takes the role of the driver.
        Their job is to steer the boat and manage the ship's energy. The other player
        takes the roll of the gunner and manages all of the ships weapon systems. This
        game was created entirely in C++.</p>

      <h1 class="content_header">Looking Back</h1>
      <p>I do not think that X-Craft turned out to be the best game that I
      had the pleasure of working, but I am definitely the most proud of it. Before
      X-Craft, I had only made games in engines and Visual Basic. X-Craft, however,
      was the first game that I worked on from the ground up in C++ with seven other
      teammates. Before starting this project, I didn't know what glGenBuffers(1, &vbo)
      meant or what it was supposed to do. I had no idea why matrix transformations could
      move graphics on the screen. I wasn't even fully comfortable with typing and entering
      git push origin [branch_name]. Now I have that aliased because it was too many
      keystrokes. Unlike any other project, this is the project that took me from a
      noobie programmer to a decent computer scientist who isn't affraid to
      get messy with some code.
