      <h1 class="main_header content_header">X-Craft</h1>
        <p>X-Craft is a 2D, top down cooperative game where two players take control
        of a boat in order to defeat enemies. One player takes the role of the driver.
        Their job is to steer the boat and manage the ship's energy. The other player
        takes the roll of the gunner and manages all of the ships weapon systems. This
        game was created entirely in C++.</p>

      <h1 class="content_header">Graphics Pipeline</h1>
      <p>While working on this game, my primary contribution was the graphics
      pipeline I created to render the game. You may have noticed that I said
      I created two graphics pipelines in the table above. It's true, I actually
      did create two, but the first was so incredibly terrible that I needed
      to go back and refactor it from the ground up. Here, I will briefly describe
      the final results of the system and how they work under the hood.</p>
      <p>- Currently Under Construction -</p>
      <h1 class="content_header">Water Technology</h1>
      <p>This project was the first project that I used custom shaders in.
      One of these was the water shader used in the game. Though it is
      not very complex, I worked on a few features in order
      to give the water a stylized look that can be changed with ease.
      <p>There were a few goals that I had to meet when creating this shader.
      It had to match the art style of the game fairly well, represent a water
      surface, and scroll across the screen to accurately represent the motion
      experienced by the player's ship</p>
      <p>Below, there is a download link to the shader's source files and two links
      to gifs that show the results produced by the water shader. The
      bulk of the shader code is in water.frag. This file has also been fully
      commented to provide an in depth explanation of the shader and how it
      works.</p>

      </ul>
      <h1 class="content_header">Looking Back</h1>
      <p>I do not think that X-Craft turned out to be the best game that I
      had the pleasure of working on, but I am definitely proud of it. Before
      X-Craft, I had only made games in pre-built engines and Visual Basic. X-Craft, however,
      was the first game that I worked on from the ground up in C++ with seven other
      talented teammates. Before starting this project, I didn't know what glGenBuffers(1, &vbo)
      meant or what it was supposed to do. I had no idea why matrix transformations could
      move graphics on the screen. I wasn't even fully comfortable with typing and entering
      git push origin [branch_name]. Now I have that aliased because it was too many
      keystrokes. Unlike any other project, this is the project that took me from a
      noobie programmer to a decent computer scientist who isn't affraid to
      get messy with some code.
