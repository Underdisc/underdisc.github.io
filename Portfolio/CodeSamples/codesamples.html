      <h1 class="main_header content_header">Code Samples</h1>
      <p>In each section on this page you will find a download link for a zip
      file containing a code sample and a brief description about
      the code you will see in the files within the archive.</p>
      <h1 class="content_header">Transform</h1>
      <p><a href="transform.zip" download>Download Transform</a></p>
      <p>These files contain the interface and implementation for a simple 2D
      transformation class that uses glm for vector and matrix containers and operations.
      The Transform class features the ability to create matrices for translations,
      scalings, and 2D rotations. It also features the ability to have parent and child
      relationships with other instances of the transform class. On top of this,
      the class also comes with unique syntax options that can be used to modify
      the translation, scale, and rotation properties of the matrix.
      <h1 class="content_header">Rendering Pipeline</h1>
      <p><a href="rendering_pipeline.zip" download>Download Rendering Pipeline</a></p>
      <p>In these files, you will find a RendererPool class and a Renderer class.
      These classes were built in order to solve the problem of rendering multiple
      spaces to a screen. For example, most games have a HUD which is displayed
      over the actual game. In the engine this pipeline was built for, that HUD
      would be in a different space than the space that the game is in. This rendering pipeline
      makes it possible to render one space on top of another using one static RendererPool
      class and multiple Renderer instances. If you would like to see more about the Engine
      this file was used for, you can find it on the <a href="../XCraft/xcraft.html">X-Craft page</a>. It was built specifically
      for the game.</p>
      <h1 class="content_header">Object Allocator</h1>
      <p><a href="object_allocator.zip">Download Object Allocator</a></p>
      <p>At DigiPen, there is one assignment that is infamous among students for
      being extremely lengthy. This assignment is the Object Allocator,
      but it also goes by the name of memory manager since that's what it is. This
      memory manager aims to replace malloc() and free() or new and delete and instead
      use a custom system for managing memory. The Object Allocator still uses
      new and delete for creating a freeing memory pages, but besides this, the Object
      Allocator manages everything in the page on its own. </p>
