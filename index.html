<p>It seems as though you have found my small corner of the internet. Thanks for stopping by. I am Underdisc, a programmer by trade, but a strange amalgamation of programmer and other things by nature.</p>
<p>This website is intended to act as a place that allows me to share what I have done and what I am currently doing. It is not made with the goal to get hired. It is made as a place where I can express myself and tell others all the things I am excited about. Feel free to stop by whenever you wish. I hope there are things I have written or shared that excite you just as much as they excite me.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re interested to know more about me, <a href="autobiography.html">here is a short autobiography</a> about who I am, what I do, and where I want to go.</p></div></div>
