        <p>Thanks for visiting my website. I am a third year student at DigiPen:
        Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in the <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/academics/degree-programs/real-time-interactive-simulation/">
        BSCS RTIS (Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive
        Simulation)</a> program in order to break my way into the games industry.</p>
        <p>Appologies in advance if the website is not great. I wrote it all in
        html and css just to get the opportunity to learn some web development.</p>
        <h1 class="content_header">Short Auto-biography</h1>
        <p>Before considering a career in games, I was first fascinated by the
        roller coaster manufacturing industry. This passion first arose because my older brother
        introduced me to the first game I played, Roller Coaster Tycoon. It wasn't until
        many years later that I decided to change this decision, however I still keep up with
        the roller coaster industry to this day.</p>
        <p> Many years later, I saw a trailer for a PS3 exclusive named
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModNation_Racers">Modnation Racers.</a>
        At the time, I didn't have a PS3 to play the game with, but
        I got one with the specific intention of playing Modnation Racers. I played
        the game almost everyday for a couple of years. It was the primary game that
        got me interested into the design section of the games industry. At the time
        I was also taking programming classes in highschool, but they didn't interest
        me as much as they do today.</p>
        <p>Once I knew I was going to make my way into games, I found a school by the name of DigiPen
        in Redmond, Washington. In my senior year of high school, I applied to the
        <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/academics/degree-programs/ba-game-design/">
        BAGD (Bachelors of Arts in Game Design)</a> program and was accepted into the school.
        After going through the first year of the program, I was not happy with the skills I was
        getting out of the design classes. Additionally, the
        math and science started to gather my interest as I watched
        my CS friends develop into great programmers. This encouraged me to eventually switch
        to the BSCS RTIS program. Though the design classes gave me many
        skills that most programmers do not have, after two years of being an RTIS,
        I can say with the utmost certainty that pursuing a programming degree was
        the correct choice for me.</p>
