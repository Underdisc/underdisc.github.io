### [Varkor](varkor/index.html)

A custom game engine I plan to use for my future projects and I hope to use for more than just games. This is what I am currently working on.

### [Amperage](amperage/index.html)

A top-down, 2D game where a player takes the role of an imaginary charge of electricity to travel through puzzling circuits that make them use more than just their mind to get by.
