# Welcome
It seems as though you have found my small corner of the internet. Thanks for stopping by. I am Underdisc, a programmer by trade, but a strange amalgamation of programmer and other things by nature.

This website is intended to act as a place that allows me to share what I have done and what I am currently doing. It is not made with the goal to get hired. It is made as a place where I can express myself and tell others all the things I am excited about. Feel free to stop by whenever you wish. I hope there are things I have written or shared that excite you just as much as they excite me.
